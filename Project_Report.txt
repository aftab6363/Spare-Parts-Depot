1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The "Spare Parts Depot" project represents a state-of-the-art web application designed to modernize the procurement of automotive spare parts. In an industry often plagued by outdated catalogs and poor inventory visibility, this platform offers a streamlined, visually immersive, and secure digital marketplace.

Built on the robust MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), the system integrates advanced inventory filtering, secure user authentication, and a responsive, "glassmorphism-inspired" user interface. The project successfully demonstrates the application of full-stack engineering principles, data security best practices, and modern frontend aesthetics to solve real-world logistical challenges.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. INTRODUCTION

2.1 Background
The global automotive aftermarket is a multi-billion dollar industry. However, finding specific parts—such as a "Stage 2 Clutch for a 2020 Mustang"—can be frustrating due to fragmented supply chains and poor digital presence of local retailers.

2.2 Problem Statement
Customers face three primary challenges:
1.  Search Friction: Difficulty finding parts by specific model numbers.
2.  Trust: Lack of clear visuals or detailed specifications online.
3.  User Experience: Most existing sites use antiquated, clunky interfaces that perform poorly on mobile devices.

2.3 Proposed Solution
Spare Parts Depot addresses these issues by providing:
*   Precision Search: A keyword-driven engine that indexes Brand, Category, and Model Number.
*   Visual Assurance: High-resolution, zoomable product imagery for every SKU.
*   VIP User Experience: A high-performance Single Page Application (SPA) with no page reloads, instant filtering, and premium animations.

2.4 Project Scope
*   User Module: Registration, Login, Profile Management, Order History.
*   Product Module: Browsing, Searching, Filtering, Detailed Views.
*   Commerce Module: Cart management, Checkout flow, Order generation.
*   Admin Module: Product CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete), User Management.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. SYSTEM ANALYSIS

3.1 Functional Requirements
*   R1: Registration: Users must be able to create accounts with email validation.
*   R2: Authentication: System must use secure tokens (JWT) for session management.
*   R3: Product Discovery: Users can filter by category (Engine, Brakes, etc.) and sort by price.
*   R4: Cart Persistence: Cart contents should persist across page navigations.
*   R5: Administrative Control: Admins must be able to edit stock levels and prices in real-time.

3.2 Non-Functional Requirements
*   Performance: All pages must load in under 1.5 seconds (Core Web Vitals).
*   Security: Passwords must never be stored in plain text.
*   Scalability: Database must handle thousands of SKUs without query degradation.
*   Responsive: UI must adapt seamlessly to Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop viewports.

3.3 Tech Stack Selection
- Frontend: React.js (Vite) - Fast rendering, component reusability, rich ecosystem.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS - Utility-first CSS for rapid, consistent, and responsive design.
- Backend: Node.js + Express - Non-blocking I/O ideal for real-time requests and API handling.
- Database: MongoDB - Flexible schema design perfect for varied product attributes.
- Auth: JWT + Bcrypt - Stateless, secure authentication standard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE

4.1 Concept
The application follows a Client-Server Architecture. The React Frontend (Client) sends HTTP JSON requests to the Node.js/Express Backend (Server), which validates requests, interacts with the MongoDB Database, and returns data.

4.2 Folder Structure
The codebase follows a modular "Separation of Concerns" pattern:
/root
  /client (Frontend)
    /public (Static Assets)
    /src
      /components (Reusable UI: Navbar, Footer, Loader)
      /pages (Views: Home, Inventory, Cart)
      /context (Global State: Auth, Cart)
      /utils (Helpers)
  /server (Backend)
    /config (DB Connection)
    /controllers (Business Logic)
    /models (Database Schemas)
    /routes (API Endpoints)
    /middleware (Auth, Error Handling)

4.3 Component Architecture
The frontend is built using Functional Components and React Hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext).
*   Global State: Implementing React Context API for AuthContext (User session) and CartContext (Shopping items), avoiding "prop drilling."
*   Routing: react-router-dom manages client-side routing, enabling the SPA experience.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. DATABASE DESIGN

The database is normalized to ensure data integrity while leveraging MongoDB's document capability for flexibility.

5.1 Entities
1.  User: Represents customers and admins.
2.  Product: Represents inventory items.
3.  Order: Represents a completed transaction.

5.2 Schema Defintions (Mongoose)

User Schema:
- Name (String, Required)
- Email (String, Unique)
- Password (String, Hashed)
- IsAdmin (Boolean)

Product (Part) Schema:
- Name (String)
- Image (String)
- Brand (String)
- Category (String, Indexed)
- Description (String)
- Price (Number)
- CountInStock (Number)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. KEY IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

6.1 Authentication & Security
*   Bcrypt Hashing: On registration, the user's password is salted and hashed (10 rounds) before storage. It is never saved as plain text.
*   JWT Handshake: On login, the server issues a standard JSON Web Token (JWT) containing the user ID. This token is stored in the client's localStorage and attached to the Authorization header of every protected API request.
*   Middleware: Custom middleware protect.js verifies this token before allowing access to private routes.

6.2 Inventory & Search Logic
The search engine is built using MongoDB's regex operator for flexibility.
*   Frontend: A debounce function allows the user to type, updating the search query state.
*   Backend: The controller accepts keyword and category query parameters, constructing a dynamic MongoDB query.

6.3 Premium UI Implementation
The "VIP Theme" was achieved using advanced CSS techniques:
*   Glassmorphism: Using backdrop-filter: blur() and semi-transparent white backgrounds to create a frosted glass effect.
*   3D Transforms: CSS perspective and customized transforms on hover give cards a tactile, physical feel.
*   Interactive Gradients: Backgrounds use radial-gradient meshes that provide depth without distracting from the content.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. API DOCUMENTATION

Base URL: /api

Authentication
*   POST /auth/register - Create a new account.
*   POST /auth/login - Authenticate and receive token.

Products
*   GET /parts - Fetch all products (supports pagination & search).
*   GET /parts/:id - Fetch single product details.
*   POST /parts - (Admin) Create new product.
*   PUT /parts/:id - (Admin) Update product stock/price.

Orders
*   POST /orders - Create a new order from cart.
*   GET /orders/myorders - Get current user's history.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. TESTING & VALIDATION

8.1 Testing Strategy
*   Unit Testing: API endpoints tested via Postman to ensure correct JSON responses and Error Codes (401, 404, 500).
*   Integration Testing: Verified the flow from Registration -> Login -> Add to Cart -> Checkout.
*   Responsive Testing: Chrome DevTools used to verify layout on iPhone SE, Pixel 5, iPad Air, and 1080p Desktop.

8.2 Test Cases Executed
1.  Negative Test: Attempt login with wrong password -> Result: "Invalid Email or Password" error (Pass).
2.  Boundary Test: Add 0 items to cart -> Result: "Cart is empty" message (Pass).
3.  Security Test: Attempt to access Admin page as User -> Result: Redirected to Home (Pass).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. CONCLUSION & FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

Conclusion
"Spare Parts Depot" successfully bridges the gap between complex automotive inventories and modern user expectations. The application is stable, secure, and visually distinctive. By leveraging the MERN stack, we achieved a highly cohesive architecture that is easy to maintain and scale.

Future Roadmap
1.  Payment Gateway: Integration with Stripe or PayPal for real credit card processing.
2.  AI Recommendations: "Users who bought this also bought..." feature using machine learning.
3.  Vehicle Compatibility: A "My Garage" feature where users save their car model, and the site automatically filters incompatible parts.
